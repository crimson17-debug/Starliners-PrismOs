# 🌟 STARLINERS - Windows OS Clone

> A web-based replication of the Windows Operating System, built by the StarLiners team.

## 📖 About The Project
This repository hosts the tasks and projects developed by **StarLiners**, a team within the **HackSlash** community. 

Our current major project is a **Windows OS Clone**, where we are replicating key features of the Windows desktop environment using standard web technologies. This project serves as a learning platform for our team to master the basics of Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and transition into advanced concepts for our upcoming internal hackathon.
